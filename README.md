🍏 Apple Electronics Sales Analysis 📊

A complete end-to-end data analysis project on Apple’s electronic product sales using SQL, Python, and Excel/Power BI.

🔍 Objective

To analyze Apple’s product sales performance across categories (iPhones, iPads, MacBooks, Watches, and Accessories), uncover revenue trends, customer preferences, and identify the key factors driving growth in different regions.

📂 Project Overview

Data Source: Simulated Apple sales dataset (50,000+ rows)

Tools Used:
🐍 Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
🧮 MySQL (queries for joins, aggregations, time-series & window functions)
📊 Excel / Power BI (visual dashboards)

⚙️ Analysis Performed

Data Cleaning & Preparation:

Removed duplicates and missing values

Standardized date and currency formats

Derived new KPIs like profit margin and revenue per unit

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Month-wise, category-wise, and country-wise revenue trends

Correlation between sales quantity, discount, and profit

Best-selling products and top-performing regions

SQL Insights:

Monthly & yearly sales aggregation

Cumulative and moving total using WINDOW FUNCTIONS

Sales above threshold (e.g., >5000 units)

Regional performance comparison

Visualization & Reporting:

Revenue vs. Product Category chart

Top 5 countries by net profit

Seasonal demand pattern (using time-series trend)

Interactive Power BI dashboard

💡 Key Insights

iPhones contribute over 45% of total revenue, but AirPods show the highest YoY growth rate (12%)

Q4 sales consistently outperform other quarters due to holiday demand

North America leads in sales volume, while Asia-Pacific shows rising margins

Discounts >15% improve volume but reduce profitability beyond an optimal point

🚀 Learning Outcomes

Gained hands-on experience in SQL analytical queries, joins, subqueries, and window functions

Applied Python for data preprocessing and visualization

Built interactive dashboards for data storytelling

Practiced business problem framing and KPI tracking
